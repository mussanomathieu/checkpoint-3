# NODE MUSICS - CHECKPOINT 3

## Disclaimer

The checkpoint is quite consequent, it's no big deal if you don't do everything before the deadline. Do your best, and most importantly HAVE FUN üòÉ

# The checkpoint itself üî•

## :zero: Setup | 30 sec

Before starting anything technical, your first mission is to clone this project, then create a branch with your lastname and firstname like so : `lastname_firstname`

## :one: Step[1] - Database modeling | 20 min

We want to build a website that allows users to discover and share cooking recipes. Your mission here is to provide a **logical data model** that meets the following constraints for the application :

- Users must be able to identify themselves on the application with a username and password.
- Several recipes can exist for a specific dish. Each dish is defined by his name and his type (starter, main course or dessert)
- Each recipe is defined by : a title, an author, a date of creation, a list of ingredients and an ordered list of steps. A recipe is always related to a dish.
- For each recipe, we should be able to find the steps of the recipe as well as the order in which they need to be done.
- For a given recipe, for each ingredient we should be able to find the quantity and the unit.
- Finally, each user must be able to add a recipe to his favorites.

### To properly model your database :

- Start by identifying **entities** and defining their **relationships** (with cardinalities) through a **conceptual data model**. Use paper/pencil to draft this first model.
- On the basis of the previous model, design the **logical data model**
  by adding attributes, foreign keys and/or junction tables.

You can use the tool of your choice to produce the database model :

- ‚úèÔ∏è Paper and pencil (my recommendation)

- üõ†Ô∏è any diagram drawing applications like [Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/fr/products/workbench/), [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), [Google Drawings](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-drawings/mkaakpdehdafacodkgkpghoibnmamcme/related?hl=fr)...

Once you're satisfied with your data model, take a picture, a screenshot or export as an image and commit it to your branch.

## :two: Step[2] - NodeJS / Express | 3 hours

### Getting started :point_down:

**In this step, you will create an API that allows you to manage songs and albums using Node/Express**

_Please please, don't forget to make atomic commits with explicit messages_ :pray:

Here is the database schema you need to create beforehand.  
You can use either SQL database you like (MySQL, SQLite, Postgresql), but cannot use noSQL (MongoDB for example).

:warning: The keys name should be the same as the schema and case sensitive, otherwise integration tests will fail ! :warning:

_don't write `albumId` instead of `id_album` for example_.

### Rules

- :white_check_mark: Response bodies should be JSON.
- :white_check_mark: Request bodies should be JSON.
- :white_check_mark: `PUT` and `DELETE` request should return `204 no content`.
- :white_check_mark: Respect as much as you can REST practices
- :white_check_mark: `POST` request should return `201 created` with the associated created resource.
- :white_check_mark: Don't remove the `module.exports = app` in the `app.js` file. We need it for the tests !
- :white_check_mark: All routes should starts with `/api`

### To Display

- :loud_sound: GET `/api/tracks`
- :loud_sound: GET `/api/tracks/1`
- :loud_sound: POST `/api/tracks`
- :loud_sound: PUT `/api/tracks`
- :loud_sound: DELETE `/api/tracks`
- :headphones: GET `/api/albums`
- :headphones: GET `/api/albums/1`
- :headphones: GET `/api/albums/1/tracks`
- :headphones: POST `/api/albums`
- :headphones: PUT `/api/albums`
- :headphones: DELETE `/api/albums`

:warning: You **NEED** to have a track in your database with the `id` 1, and an album with the `id` 1.

### Your mission

Here are some user stories about what you need to do:

- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve the full list of tracks
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve one track by its ID
- As a user, I need to be able to create a new track
- As a user, I need to be able to update a track
- As a user, I need to be able to delete a track
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve the full list of albums
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve one album by its ID
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve the tracks list of one album
- As a user, I need to be able to create a new album
- As a user, I need to be able to update an album
- As a user, I need to be able to delete an album


## It's done ! Congrats !

You can now chill :beers:
